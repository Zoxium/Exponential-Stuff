# Formulaic Expressions

This is <b>NOT</b> finished. You will see bugs.

Exponential Stuff is an incremental game with exponential mechanics.
You will see generators in this game multiplying each other and not adding, unlike those polynomial incrementals like Antimatter Dimensions.
I'm not comparing my game to AD, but I tried making an incremental.
If you've never played Antimatter Dimensions, I suggest you try it out. It's a game that gives you a really nice experience for a really long time.
Developer put a lot of effort into that game.
